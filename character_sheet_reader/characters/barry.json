        "backstory": "I been told me story is like to bring common folk to tears when I tell \nit, but it's really a merry tale full of life and long lived--pass me \nthe wineskin--where to begin? \n\nAh grew up on the banks of Bonny \nBay where the salt breeze sweeps over grassy rocks in the Northern sea. \nCold nights and icy mornings, the kind that make a fellow snore as his \nnostrils freeze over. But warm sun and all the fruits of the sea. Bonny \nBay may look a bit desolate, I grant yeh, but the deeps of the sea are \nworth more acres o'farmland than I've ever seen with me two eyes. \n\n\n\nAh grew up playing on the rocks-pop never made much doing patchwork on the ships and ma ran as a washer at the Galvan tavern, the nice establishment, you see. We made enough to keep a couple rooms on the waterfront, but we were never the money in the town. That was fer the sailor kids, especially the navy sons, right royal bastards for the most part, but they weren't all the same, that's true. Grew up learning lots of the languages from them, little bits an' pieces here and there. Comes in handy dockside, I tell ya, what with everyone speakin' a different tongue. Ah was what they might've called a pond-wader, makin' a couple bronzes on pulling up mollusks during the days an' selling em dockside. Rock snailswere most common, then pygmy zebra snails, the little one's with the striped shells, good fer eating if you've got a stove that can get up the heat, though you've got to have a lot of em. If I got to go out on the scows, which weren't often, ah pulled up Northern oysters and barnacles (meat's better than you think it is). Here ah go talking snails again. Point bein, ah learned how to cook snails. \n\n\nTook up a job as a kitchen boy at the Smelly Nickle, the not-so-nice tavern in Bonny Bay, but knew how to cook snails and caught on right fast to fish. Mostly they brought up cod, bu' also tuna an' shark an' monkfish, sometimes mackerel and marlin if ye were lucky. Ah got to the point where I got to be cook... ah suppose it's not much of a story, ask me about it an' I'll tell ye all the foreign fish foods ah learned to make. Got em all tucked away upstairs, even now. \n\n\n\nWell, the ships were comin' more an' more often, and bringin' in less an' less each time. I didnae think much of it in the beginning, but now ah look back and think, we should have seen it comin'. Soon, nae one fish could be caught in Bonny Bay, an' just like that, all the ships found a different berth. Bonny Bay used to be a treasure; now, it's just a desert. \n\n\nI took off after that. Me ma and pa were well gone, an' I never much settled down with naebody, so I 'ad places to go. I went South, sailin' along the coast, until I found water full of life again. That's the kinds of places ah live now. An, if I see those ships haulin' tons of fish into the port towns, let's just say those ships find a way to sink, if ye follow me. Don't be takin' more than ye need, or y'll make an enemy out of me an' mine. \n\n",
